## Conclusion and Next Steps

The DarkEscape VR is not perfect, it still requires some improvements, and more user tests to reach a more refined version. But, just with a couple users, it was possible to see the importance of the iterations for VR development.

The next steps for the game would be to change the clock indicators, as suggested by User Test 3, and run more user testing.
